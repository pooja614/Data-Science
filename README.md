#### Sentimental Analysis of Book Reviews with Bidirectional LSTM

* The project deals with sentimental binary classification of book
reviews. 
* The text data is preprocessed, lemmatization, text
vectorization, layer embedding parameters is experimented,
modelling using bidirectional LSTM, stacked bidirectional LSTM.
* Fine tuning through parameter search for nodes, number of hidden layers
and dropout regularization.
* Stacked bidirectional LSTM yields 80% accuracy.

#### Skim Literature
* Project aims to skim the literature and classify its sections: objective,
methods, background, results and conclusion.
* Logistic Regression is used for classification.

#### Weather Recognition
* This Deep Learning project deals with multiclass classification of weather
images using CNN.
* EDA, experimentation with sequential model as well as modelling
through transfer learning. Dataset is augmented, dropout regularization
is applied, callbacks and early stopping is employed.
* Adam optimizers' learning rate is experimented and fine- tuned.
* Sequential Model has given 86% training accuracy and 78% test accuracy.
